# Data Projects – TripleTen Capstone Portfolio

A curated collection of **15 end-to-end data science and machine learning projects** completed during the [TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp](https://tripleten.com/). Each project showcases **real-world business applications**, evolving technical skills, and refined data storytelling.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a **capstone showcase** of my TripleTen journey — from exploratory analysis to advanced modeling. It reflects my growth in data analytics, statistical reasoning, and model interpretation across multiple industries.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Python & `pandas` for data cleaning and analysis
- `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM` for modeling
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- SQL for data collection and querying
- Forecasting & hypothesis testing
- NLP (spaCy, TF-IDF), computer vision (CNN), time series forecasting
- Model evaluation with `AUC-ROC`, `RMSE`, `MAE`, `F1`, and `sMAPE`
