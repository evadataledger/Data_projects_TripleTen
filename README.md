# Data_projects_TripleTen
A curated collection of data science and machine learning project completed during the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. Each project demonstrates growth in technical skills, business insight, and data storytelling. 

Welcome to my portfolio of data science projects completed during the TripleTen Data Science Pgogram (https://tripleten.com/). Each project showcases real-world business scenarios solved using Pything, machine learning, and data analysis. 

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a **capstone collection** of my TripleTen journey - from exploratory analysis to predictive modeling. It reflects both technical growth and the ability to derive insights from complex data. 

### Skills Demonstrated
- Python & pandas for data cleaning and analysis.
- Scikit-learn & XGBoost for modeling.
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Business problem framing & interpretation.
- NLP, computer vision, and time series forecasting.
- Model evaluation using AUc-ROC, RMSE, sMAPE.
