# Project 10: Linear Algebra – Sure Tomorrow Insurance

## Objective
Apply linear algebra and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems for the Sure Tomorrow insurance company. The project focuses on customer similarity, classification, linear regression, and secure data obfuscation.

## Tasks

1. **Customer Similarity**  
   - Use vector distances to find customers with similar characteristics.

2. **Binary Classification**  
   - Predict if a customer will receive an insurance benefit.
   - Compare a trained model vs. a dummy classifier.

3. **Regression**  
   - Predict the **number** of benefits using **Linear Regression**.
   - Use matrix operations, including the Normal Equation.

4. **Data Obfuscation**  
   - Create a transformation that protects personal data while maintaining model accuracy.

## Tools & Techniques

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`
- Cosine similarity
- DummyClassifier, RandomForest, LinearRegression
- Linear Algebra: matrix multiplication, inverse, identity matrix
- Data masking (matrix-based transformation)

## What I Learned

- How to implement similarity measures for marketing intelligence.
- Linear algebra fundamentals behind machine learning (Normal Equation).
- Model evaluation: dummy vs. real.
- Obfuscation strategies to protect sensitive data.
