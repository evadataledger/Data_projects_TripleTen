## Folder Structure

- `notebooks/` — Contains all Jupyter Notebooks for this project.
  - `Project_1_IMDB_Top1000.ipynb` — Public version using Kaggle dataset
  - `Project_1_Basic_TripleTen.ipynb` — TripleTen-inspired cleaned version
- `../../datasets/` — Shared dataset folder used across all projects

Organizing notebooks this way keeps the project modular and easy to expand in the future.
