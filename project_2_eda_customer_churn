# Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis on Customer Churn

## Objective 
To identify patterns and relationships that contribute to customer churn using visual and statistical EDA techniques. 
Understand these patterns will allow businesses to take proactive action to reduce customer attrition. 

## Tools & Techniques 
- Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Grouped comparisons, value counts, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots

## Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are far more likely to churn.
- Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn rates.
- Customers with shorter tenure tend to churn more frequently.
- Lack of certain services (like internet) also correlates with retention.

## Data
The dataset contains anonymized customer records, including: 
- Contract types (monthly, yearly)
- Service usage (internet, phone, streaming)
- Demographic data
- Monthly charges and total charges
- Church status (target variable)

Dataset is stored centrally in the /datasets/ folder as customer_churn_data.csv

## What I learned
- How to ask targeted business questions and test hypotheses with EDA
- The power of visual storytelling for identifying business trends
- Applying correlation and grouped analysis to understand customer behavior
