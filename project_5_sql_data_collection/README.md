# Project 5: Data Collection and Storage (SQL)

## Objective

Analyze ride-sharing data for **Zuber**, a new Chicago-based taxi startup, to find patterns in competitior rides and test hypotheses about weather effects on ride frequency. 

## Datasets 

- `project_sql_result_04.csv` — Number of rides per taxi company
- `project_sql_result_07.csv` — Neighborhood-level ride summaries
- `project_sql_result_08.csv` — Weather-related data for November 2017

## Tools & Skills Used

- SQL queries
- Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning
- Hypothesis Testing

## Key Questions Explored

- What companies received the most rides?
- How do ride volumes vary by neighborhood?
- Is there a relationship between weather and ride frequency?

## Outcomes

- Identified top-performing taxi companies
- Verified ride concentration in certain neighborhoods
- Found support for the hypothesis: **fewer rides occurred on bad weather days**
